**Library of custom components for personal use**

These are some components I've made to aid in the development of new websites using React, Tailwind, the Tailwind Merge plugin, and React Visibility Sensor.

If for some reason you want to, please feel free to use these components in whatever way you wish. I'm also open to advice and contributions.
